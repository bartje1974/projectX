# projectX
A simple php framework

It had to be simple and easy, ready to use.
No tricky things like command line because there are projects where you do not have those options.
for example shared hosting. The framework is still in development so not yet ready for real use.

## Features What has the framework on board?
- Has an MVC approach.
- It works with namespaces.
- A simple autoloader to load the classes.
- A simple config file where most of the options can be specified.
- Works with PDO, so you can talk to severals databases.

## System Requirements.
- A Web server, apache with a database and PHP version greater than PHP5.4 is required.
- To use SEO friendly urls ModRewrite must be enabeled.

## How does it work?
Simple. :)
- Download the zip file or clone the repository.
- Unzip the zip file and upload it to your web server.
- Adjust the config.ini in the folder /projectx/core/config/config.ini.
- The framework is ready for action.



## Bonus!
The actual framework is actually composed of 10 files including the config file to make a cool application.
But i am not the most difficult guy. 
So have some additional classes in the vendor directory that makes your life as programmer a lot easier.

- A simple ORM / CRUD class.
- An ACL class.
- A shopping cart class.
- A form class.
- Encryption a class (for passwords).
- A messasge class for beautiful messages.
- A spam buster clas.
In the near future will still be added to classes there.

## Have I forgotten something?
I do not think so.
Oh yes, there is one more thing: The license.
You are free to hack the code to use.
Does my name need to remain in the code? No, feel free to use it as you want.
All code I've written with inspiration after searching the internet on forums. 
The most I have rewritten my own taste and ideas how I think they should work.

## The manual?
If the framework is ready for a real application, I will make a clear manual.
But the framework is not yet entirely finished.
There is still a universal way be made of work, which is not present yet at this time.
Do you have some good ideas to improve the framework?
